        "\n",
        "**Purpose:** This project, \"GradeMate: Predictive Student Performance,\" aims to develop a data-driven model for **\"ExcelEdge Institute\"** to predict student academic performance based on study habits, empowering educators and students with valuable information for academic success.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Methodology:** Leveraging data on student study habits, previous GPA, and extracurricular activities, we employed a Linear Regression model to predict student scores. The model was trained and evaluated using various techniques, including hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Findings:** A strong positive correlation between study hours and student scores was observed, suggesting that dedicated effort leads to better academic outcomes. Students with higher previous GPAs tend to have more extracurricular activities, indicating a potential link between academic excellence and engagement beyond the classroom. GradeMate accurately predicts student performance, achieving a 0.93 R-squared.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Recommendations:** ExcelEdge Institute can leverage GradeMate for early identification of at-risk students, personalized support, and data-driven adjustments to learning strategies. Students can use GradeMate to understand the impact of their study habits on their potential performance, set realistic goals, and track their progress toward achieving them.\n"
